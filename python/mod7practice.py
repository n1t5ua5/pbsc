# Assignment 1. 🖥️

# Create a program that accepts a list of 7 integers as input and rearranges
# it by shifting all elements one position to the left, with the first element
# wrapping around to become the new last element. Employ a while loop to input
# these integers into the list, then display the updated list as a whole.
# (See example below)

# Sample console:
# >>Enter integer number 1 of 7: 11
# >>Enter integer number 2 of 7: 22
# >>Enter integer number 3 of 7: 33
# >>Enter integer number 4 of 7: 44
# >>Enter integer number 5 of 7: 55
# >>Enter integer number 6 of 7: 66
# >>Enter integer number 7 of 7: 77
# >>The list shifted one position to the left is: [22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 11]


# Assignment 2. 🔢

# Create a program that prompts the user to input a list of names, separated
# by a semicolon (;). The program should then count and display the total
# number of names entered. Additionally, the program should identify and
# display the name that would come first (alphabetically) and the name that
# would come last (alphabetically) in the list.
# (See example below)

# Sample console:
# >>Enter a list of names, separated by semicolons: Alice;Bob;Charlie;David
# >>Total number of names entered: 4
# >>The name that comes first alphabetically is: Alice
# >>The name that comes last alphabetically is: David
