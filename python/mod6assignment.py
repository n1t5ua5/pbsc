# Please complete BOTH Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

# Assignment 1.

# Develop a program that takes input values in USD dollars and converts them
# into three different currencies: Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, and Canadian
# Dollar. The program should include three distinct functions named
# pound_conversion, japanese_conversion, and canadian_conversion, all of which
# should be called within the main part of the code and return the appropriate
# exchange amounts. Conversion rates are provided below:

# $1.00 USD --> $0.77 Pound Sterling
# $1.00 USD --> $157.50 Japanese Yen
# $1.00 USD --> $1.37 Canadian Dollar
# (Values are based as of August 2024)

# Assignment 2.

# Create a program that uses a function to calculate the gross pay for
# full-time employees in an organization. The program should first prompt
# users to enter their hourly rate and the number of hours worked. A function
# should then be defined to accept two parameters: the hourly rate and the
# hours worked, with a default value of 40 hours representing a standard
# workweek. The function should compute the gross pay, where the base pay for
# regular hours is the hourly rate, and any hours worked beyond 40 hours are
# paid at a 1.5x rate of the regular hourly pay; it should then return the
# total gross pay when called within the main program.
