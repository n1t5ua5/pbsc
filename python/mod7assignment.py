# Assignment 1.

# Create a program that accepts a list of 5 integers as input and rearranges
# it by swapping the first and last numbers. Employ a loop to input these
# integers into the list, then display the updated list as a whole.
# (See example below)

# Sample console:
# >>Enter a string of numbers. 2
# >>Enter a string of numbers. 4
# >>Enter a string of numbers. 6
# >>Enter a string of numbers. 8
# >>Enter a string of numbers. 10
# >>The first and last numbers swapped is: [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]


# Assignment 2.

# Create a program that prompts the user to input a list of numbers, separated
# by commas. The program should then calculate and display the total and
# average of these numbers. Additionally, the program should identify and
# display the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
