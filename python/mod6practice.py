# Assignment 1: International Currency Exchange Program 🌍
# Develop a program that takes an input value in US Dollars (USD)
# and converts it into three different foreign currencies: Euro,
# Chinese Yuan, and South Korean Won.

# The program must include three distinct functions, each accepting the USD
# amount as input and returning the calculated foreign currency amount:

# euro_converter
# yuan_converter
# won_converter

# All three functions should be called within the main part of the code.
# Use the following conversion rates:

# $1.00 USD→0.86 Euro
# $1.00 USD→7.13 Chinese Yuan
# $1.00 USD→1410.00 South Korean Won

# Assignment 2: Sales Commission Calculator Program 💰
# Create a program that uses a function to determine the total sales
# commission earned by a salesperson. The program should first prompt
# users to enter the salesperson's monthly sales total and their
# commission rate (as a decimal).

# A function, named calculate_commission, should be defined to accept
# two parameters: the monthly sales total and the commission rate,
# with a default value of 0.05 (5%) for the commission rate.

# The function should compute the total commission, applying a bonus
# multiplier for high performance:

# The base commission is the monthly sales total multiplied by the commission
# rate. If the monthly sales total is greater than $10,000, the salesperson
# earns a 1.25x bonus on their base commission (i.e., the final commission
# is 1.25 times the base commission). The function must then return the
# total final commission when called within the main program.
