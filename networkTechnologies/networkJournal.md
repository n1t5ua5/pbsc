## 1. Discuss how these certifications could impact your career trajectory.

It's worthwhile to obtain & showcase accredited certifications when looking for work because it shows employers where your specialties are & affirms yourself as a legitimate professional in the business world. I obtained two separate certifications prior to taking this course too, so while that would include four in total, I might only put two or three on my resume, depending on the job I'm applying for. I'd highly recommend to all my fellow computer science majors that they should try to obtain at least one certification in addition to your degree, but don't stop by looking at only CompTIA+, there's plenty of programs that offer similar certifications such as CIW, IWA, GAQM, W3C, IEEE & many more.

Tech industry leaders like Oracle, Microsoft & Google also provide certifications for web developers that are deemed worthwhile & in some instances, mandatory - it just depends on the type of job you have. But if it's for one of those big companies, they might even require two or more certifications from within their network & one outside of their network but again it all depends on the type of work you're doing. As for myself, I'm looking to obtain either the Network+ or Security+ certifications because even though I'm not trying to become a network or security engineer, I want to get a better grasp on those issues because I don't want to leave myself or my clients vulnerable to these sorts of threats.
