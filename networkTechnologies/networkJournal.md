## Thwarting Modern Phishing Scams

Something that I read about recently gave me a new perspective on protecting oneself from new types of phishing scams that originate from misspelled domain names.  In the past, commonly misspelt domain names simply led to 404 or 503 errors, & such which represent generic programming errors. But unethical hackers have slowly but surely purchased a lot of these misspelt domain names in hopes of intercepting vulnerable servers that visit the site who unknowingly take part in phishing scams. This has also become commonly known as ‘typosquatting’.

According to internet security giant Cloudflare, a phishing attack occurs when a user is tricked into taking some sort of action online. But regarding the occurrence above, all a user needs to do is simply visit a website – they don’t need to take any other specific action to fall victim to this cybercrime. Clicking X out of the site won’t resolve this either.

One of the easiest ways you can prevent this misfortune from occurring is by making bookmarks of your most used web addresses within the browser you’re using; that way, you can ensure that you’re visiting the same site every time, no matter what. It’s a simple remedy too because it’s extremely easy to do (just click the star button on the right side of the URL address bar for the quickest way to do this) & this feature exists in every type of internet browser, so user preferences don’t get in the way of this common ailment. 

Another common phishing scam that you should be aware of exists through texting & puts you through an endless self-imposed loop. If you ever receive a text message from a number you’re unfamiliar with & the first or second thing mentioned to you asks for either money or your personal information – DON’T respond with words such as “Stop” or “Unsubscribe”.

Instead, avoid opening the text message altogether & select the message like you’re going to delete it from your message inbox & click something along the lines of ‘Report Spam’ or ‘Block Number’ (sometimes you can choose both). This will alert your cell provider that a supposed scam is stemming from that number & it also means that you don’t need to respond to the message in any shape or form: so, the scammer can’t initiate their plan to steal your money or data, which has been disguised as a phishing scheme.

## 1. Discuss how these certifications could impact your career trajectory.

It's worthwhile to obtain & showcase accredited certifications when looking for work because it shows employers where your specialties are & affirms yourself as a legitimate professional in the business world. I obtained two separate certifications prior to taking this course too, so while that would include four in total, I might only put two or three on my resume, depending on the job I'm applying for. I'd highly recommend to all my fellow computer science majors that they should try to obtain at least one certification in addition to your degree, but don't stop by looking at only CompTIA+, there's plenty of programs that offer similar certifications such as CIW, IWA, GAQM, W3C, IEEE & many more.

Tech industry leaders like Oracle, Microsoft & Google also provide certifications for web developers that are deemed worthwhile & in some instances, mandatory - it just depends on the type of job you have. But if it's for one of those big companies, they might even require two or more certifications from within their network & one outside of their network but again it all depends on the type of work you're doing. As for myself, I'm looking to obtain either the Network+ or Security+ certifications because even though I'm not trying to become a network or security engineer, I want to get a better grasp on those issues because I don't want to leave myself or my clients vulnerable to these sorts of threats.
