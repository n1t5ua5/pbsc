## 2. What are the differences between hacktivists & state-sponsored attackers? Which of the two types of attackers, hacktivists or state actors, do you think offers the highest degree of threat?

One quality for hacktivists & one quality for state-sponsored attackers stands out to me for both: hacktivists work independently of formal governmental entities while state-sponsored attackers explicitly work on their behalf (whether or not they're formally working as contractors or not). Hacktivists generally take to solving complex social issues, while state-sponsored attackers seek to advance national interests that are made at the discretion of policy makers & politicians. It doesn't matter if their effects are done to public or private entities either. Hacktivists & the groups they work with are generally less sophisticated in terms of organizational structure.

While the damage done by hacktivists can be irreparable, state-sponsored attackers are generally more of a threat because they are shielded by a legal system that's recognized by the rest of the world (whether for better or worse). Hacktivists generally try to evade working with the government no matter what the circumstances are but if they're caught doing something that's deemed as illegal, they could be extradited or punished by the full extent of the law from the country they're operating inside. State-sponsored attackers on the other hand can take responsibility for the crimes they commit while still potentially avoiding punishment by legal authorities. This is true no matter which country you live in: free or unfree, these circumstances are unchanging. Neither group should be underestimated because the damage committed by either can be catastrophic.

## Module 1: 1/13/2026

## 1. Research a real-world enterprise or government network breach & analyze how a lack of proper network security component placement contributed to the breach. How could a layered defense strategy have mitigated or prevented the attack? Be specific in referencing network architecture elements (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, DMZs). 

In the analysis provided by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Red Team, the breach described was mostly due to a "flat" network infrastructure which lacked proper internal barriers. From the inside looking out, everything appeared secure but in reality the organization being assessed failed to put crucial security systems in place like essential firewalls. Once a single workstation became compromised, they quickly realized their defenses had been breeched due to stolen credentials. 

Besides installing firewall programs on your device, one major way developers can prevent cyber attacks is by employing a layered defense strategy which can detect all incoming traffic. Instead of relying on one strong "shell" at the edge, a layered security approach creates multiple checkpoints which can raise alarms internally to act before anything worse is done. Additionally, staff training will need to be implemented to ensure that management thoroughly understands it's organizations security infrastructure & therefore the rest of the staff.
